web-crawler
===========

Simple tool to crawl a single domain (to a specified depth) and store content for offline use.


Goals:

1. parse and cache content from a single domain for offline use (e.g., to store some reference material so I can code on a plane.)

2. enable automatic diffs of pages across time.

3. learn more about clojure's tree processing (meta-level goal).
